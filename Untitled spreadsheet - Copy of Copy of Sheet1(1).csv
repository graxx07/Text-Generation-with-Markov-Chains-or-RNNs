quote
Ladies. Gentlemen. You have eaten well. You have eaten Gotham's wealth. Its spirit. Your feast is nearly over. From this moment on -- none of you are safe.
You're wrong. Batman and Robin will never die.
But that's the thing about Batman. Batman thinks of everything
A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended.
I'm Batman.
I think we can take them. Do you think we can take them.
Every damn night. And yet... I’m still here.
I’m the goddamn Batman.
"If you are good, the shadow's wings are a welcome, protective blanket."
"I wear a mask. And that mask, it’s not to hide who I am, but to create what I am."
"I've put out a few fires, yes. Won a few battles. But the war goes on, Alfred... on and on..."
"The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point."
"Maybe that's what Batman is about. Not winning. But failing, and getting back up. Knowing he'll fail, fail a thousand times, but still won't give up."
You can never escape me. Bullets don't harm me. Nothing harms me. But I know pain.
"The voice kept calling me Bruce. In my mind, that's not what I call myself."
No miracles. No mercy. No redemption. No heaven. No hell. No higher power. Just life. Just... us.
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
"Sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."
If I allow myself to go down into that place… I’ll never come back.
All men have limits. They learn what they are and learn not to exceed them. I ignore mine.
Batman punches people in the face.
Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind.
I chose this life. I know what I'm doing.
Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot.
"It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me."
"You don't get it, boy. This isn't a mud hole. It's an operating table. And I'm the surgeon."
Sometimes it's only madness that makes us what we are.
"When that light hits the sky, it’s not just a call. It’s a warning."
I am Vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman.
Shut up and fight.
"Do you wanna know something funny. Even after everything you’ve done, I would’ve saved you."
The world only makes sense if you force it to.
Vengeance Won't Change The Past. Mine or anyone else's. I have to become more. People need hope.
"Our scars can destroy us, even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight."
"Yes, father. I shall become a bat."
Swear to me.
"Good grammar is essential, Robin."
"That's one trouble with dual identities, Robin. Dual responsibilities."
I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.
"As a man; I am flesh and blood; I can be ignored, I can be destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting."
"Not you, Robin. They have strict licensing laws in this country. A boy of your age is not allowed in a drinking tavern."
"The true crimefighter always carries everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin."
"She wants to kill you, Dick."
You wanna get nuts. Come on. Let's get nuts.
"Maybe that's what Batman is about. Not winning, but failing, and getting back up. Knowing he'll fail, fail a thousand times, but still won't give up."
"No miracles. No mercy. No redemption. No heaven. No hell. No Higher Power. Just life, just...us."
I don't blend in at a family picnic.
It is the duty of every good citizen of Gotham City to report meeting a man from Mars in a public park.
"I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I."
The bat-signal is not a beeper.
"Let that be a lesson. In the future, be more careful from who you accept free lemonade."
"It's obvious. Only a criminal would disguise himself as a licensed, bonded guard yet callously park in front of a fire hydrant."
"I'm a night-stalking, crime-fighting vigilante, and a heavy metal rapping machine. I don't feel anything emotionally, except for rage."
"Yeah. We have to right a wrong. And sometimes, in order to right a wrong, you have to do a wrong-right."
There is no us. Batman and Joker are not a thing. I don't need you. I don't need anyone. You mean nothing to me. No one does.
Some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb …
"I thought I’d found an opponent to match wits with, but you’re just another lunatic in a costume."
"I had a bad day too, once."
Sorry. Crime doesn’t take dinner breaks and neither do I.
There are two things in life everyone’s powerless against. Love and revenge.
"I smiled. Not out of happiness. But because I knew … that one day, I wouldn’t have to do this anymore. One day, I could stop fighting. Because one day … I would win. One day, there will be no pain, no loss, no crime. Because of me, because I fight. For you. One day, I will win."
You prefer to call me Batman. But the reason you can never escape me … is that my name is fear. And I live within you.
The Batman doesn’t compromise. I keep the city safe … even if it’s safer by just one person.. And I do not ever give in or give up.
"People think it’s an obsession. A compulsion. As if there were an irresistible impulse to act. It’s never been like that. I chose this life. I know what I’m doing. And on any given day, I could stop doing it. Today, however, isn’t that day. And tomorrow won’t be either."
"Everyone gets scared. And that’s fine. Be scared. But remember, all that means is everyone gets the opportunity to fight that fear. Everyone gets the chance to be brave."
"I’ve been thinking a lot lately. About you and me. About what’s going to happen to us, in the end. We’re going to kill each other, aren’t we. Perhaps you’ll kill me. Perhaps I’ll kill you. Perhaps sooner, perhaps later. I just wanted to know that I’d made a genuine attempt to talk things over and avert that outcome. Just once."
"There is a difference between you and me. We both looked into the abyss, but when it looked back at us, you blinked."
